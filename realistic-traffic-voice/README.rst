Realistic traffic example - Voice test
======================================

This example is meant as an introduction to the ByteBlower Test Framework.

It shows how to initiate a Voice over IP (G.711 codec metrics simulation) test.

The script generates downstream and upstream traffic between a WAN and CPE port.

The analysis calculates the Mean Opinion Score (MOS),  frame loss,
generates throughput and latency graphs over time.
