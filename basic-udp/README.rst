=======================================
Basic example - UDP frame blasting test
=======================================

This example is meant as an introduction to the ByteBlower Test Framework.

It shows how to initiate a UDP (frame blasting) test.

The script generates downstream and upstream traffic between a WAN and CPE port.

The analysis calculates frame loss and generates throughput and latency graphs over time.
